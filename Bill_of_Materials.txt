JLCPCB
 - Custom PCBs from jlcpcb; the zip file that must be uploaded can be found at [https://github.com/Baigel/Macropad/blob/master/pcb/Macropad_Gerber_Files.zip]; the default settings on https://cart.jlcpcb.com/ are fine although the dimensions must be 100mm by 100mm

Price Estimate: $5 [PCB] + $8 [standoffs] + 2x$20 [Pro Micro] + 2x$3 [Switches] + 20x$0.1 [Sockets] + $4 [OLED Display] + $1 [Reset Button] + 30x$0.15 [Capacitors] + 30x$0.25 [Diodes] + $9 [RGB LEDs] + $8 [Digikey Ruler] = $92
